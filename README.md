# Deploying a Machine Learning model with FastAPI

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a scalable machine learning pipelinbe using FastAPI. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and API Endpoints for inference.

## Project Overview
This is a project based on UCI Machine Learning Repository data set of 1994 Census Bureau data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income). This data was a predicaiton task used to determine wheter a person makes over $50k a year.

Details about the model can be found on the model card.

The Github link is https://github.com/jschl34/Deploying-a-Scalable-ML-Pipeline-with-FastAPI.git

## Features
Data preprocessing with reusable functions.
Model training and evaluation.
Data slice performance analysis for categorical features.
RESTful API for inference with GET and POST endpoints.
Unit testing for pipeline components.
